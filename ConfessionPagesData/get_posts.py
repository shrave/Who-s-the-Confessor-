# This is an honest confession.
# There is this guy who plays awesome guitar. He even played in the Freshers for the Agni House. I think that Agni came second just because of him. I see him around often in Vindhya canteen but I don't know his name. I would really like to know him more and become friends. I bet everyone is fan of his electric guitar.
# Please comment his name.
