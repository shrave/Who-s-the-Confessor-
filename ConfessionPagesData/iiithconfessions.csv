249	-	4 March 2017	-	#285	This is for the first year students and others too. I recently saw your video where most of the students were leaving class after the attendance. As a senior and a TA, let me tell you it's very bad on your part when you do such kind of thing. You may feel that the professor is chill with this but deep inside he/she feels like shit. Just… More imagine yourself from his/her perspective. Deep inside, he/she feels dejected and someone who is ignored. I do realize that some professors teach like shit but just to maintain the dignity of that professor, don't leave your classrooms. Just sleep in the class or spend your time on mobile, but please don't leave the class. Some may disagree with this, saying that the professor should be open-minded or why one should then even use mobile phones and sleep, but this is my point of view, rest it's on you guys to either follow it or reject it.

265	-	4 March 2017	-	#269	Cheers to another stand up for the house. Being a prithvian, I am a very down to earth person. I am so down to earth, that I live in a burrow. A burrow so deep that I started digging down from here and ended up in amrita university, for icpc. See, how down to earth I am. Another day, we was planning to book a seat on the bullet train from… More ahmedabad to Bombay :-). Soon enough I realized a burrow can be dug faster. I am so down to earth that I don't travel by flight. Travelling on boat is like, so suffocating. It is so much far away from earth. So,I travel on water by crawlling on the seabed. It has fun of its own. I know I am so strong and egoistic, that I will dare the admin to come forward, But I would like to apologize before hand. Thanks for your time	11:50

Is it because of the fact that he is a good person? If you genuinely have any problems with him, go talk to him in person, I'm sure he'll manage to think of a good enough solution for  your problems.	11:22
