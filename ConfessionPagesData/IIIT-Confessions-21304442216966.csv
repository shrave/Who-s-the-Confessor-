While i was deeply engrossed in it, there was this Prof. AM who gatecrashed out of blue. Thanks to the bushes and no light - but i still am not sure whether he purposefully ignored us, or he never actually saw us! But he sure did send some shivers down my spine.

I all I do is sit on my bum from 9:45 and keep trying with brute force to book a ticket. The worst thing is if I don't succeed he asks me why I was not able to book a ticket. As if I knowâ€¦ More what the guys in IRCTC do with their servers. I have a confess that I think my laptop can handle more requests than an IRCTC server.	06:27
