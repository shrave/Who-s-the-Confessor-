I am deeply in love with a PG1 girl. I see her everyday in the library or in the Kadamba mess. She's really cute and has the best curves in the world. One day i saw her in JC in a yellow top and I fell head-over-heels for her. Ma'am can we meet in JC? 12am tonight, Avocado's on me.

Hi all,
This is regarding #121. If it is genuine, and I really think it is, it may be something to be concerned about. I sincerely recommend you to talk about this to a senior(preferably UG2 because same hostel), anyone who you think can help you with this. We will all be happy to help. Cheer up!

The requirements to be a good boyfriend are invited from girls. So that I can judge myself that to whom I am fit as a boyfriend. The requirements will also help us to change ourselves to be fit for our crushes. So girls comment on this as much as possible for you. This is basic need of each single.

I really like a girl from UG-1, her name is Fiza and she is really beautiful. Though I have never talked to her, we had small conversations regarding minor issues like she asked me if the chair beside me was empty. I think she is really cute and should have been the Miss Flair. Nevertheless, I am the one who clicks the best pics in the batch and am learning Guitar to impress you. Please talk to me when I approach you!

I have a crush on a boy from UG1 who has curly hair and is really smart. He sings well and can also dance. I see him almost everyday but never even had the guts to ask his name. He always roams with other girls which I don't like at all. I just want him to notice me and spend time with me. He is from prithvi house.

Some of my batch mates had hurt me a lot till now... Perhaps they don't realise that.... I am really thankful to the admins of this group.... For creating this page.... Even if the confession is not approved.. I will have a relief at least that I spilled everything out...... My last 2 posts have not been approved....😣😣😣☹️☹️☹️☹️😟😟😞😞

Can someone help me in meeting him.
I won't tell his name but can give you all a hint.
Hint: (He is lean and clean-shaved)
If he replies to this post, I'll assume he is interested and would like to take it forward.

This confession is for Vivek Nannaka sir Of UG2.
It was in the mess , I saw him for the first time. The way he used to smile, the way he used to interact with everyone attracted me a lot. But he is very shy in front of me. Whenever I came across him, he used to hide his face and walk away. I just want to know about him and want to spend some time with him.
I request my ug-2 bhaiyyas to make somethings work out between us.

With reference to the ug1 mumbai girl post (initials RR)
I am in the same house(vayu),same cluster, same group for activities,workshops and had the same default mess as yours. Now we have different groups for classes thanks to the evil app€€ji but we do meet on Saturdays!!!!
##This was just to clear the air!!!
Admin please do post my life depends on u
UG1-M no worries :p should be easy to track down you and her 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

To Chandu sir from UG3 ,
why do you have such a great fan following? Almost every girl in our batch has a shy crush on you. I don't know why? :|
Could some one please tag that chandu and tell me the reason why!
UG1-F who's chandu sir? is it chandani* sir?
