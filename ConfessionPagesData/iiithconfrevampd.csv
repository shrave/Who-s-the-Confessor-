5	-	19 September	-	#129	Yash sir! You have never taken my intro but I always wished you did it because I never got a chance to talk to you. Also, you are cute. Please comment if you are interested in meeting me....	07:23
6	-	19 September	-	#128	I am deeply in love with a PG1 girl. I see her everyday in the library or in the Kadamba mess. She's really cute and has the best curves in the world. One day i saw her in JC in a yellow top and I fell head-over-heels for her. Ma'am can we meet in JC? 12am tonight, Avocado's on me.	07:09
7	-	19 September	-	#127	Why are we not stopping sir-ma'am culture? It's really unnecessary and I don't want to call my seniors as sir neither I want my juniors to call me sir. I think most of the people think like this but they just don't want to speak.	06:57
8	-	19 September	-	#126	I know I won't be the only one to say this to this UG3 girl but I so have to. Everytime I see you I am mesmerized by your simplicity, beauty and, yes, that smile üòâ. You're adorable and I just can't take my eyes off you. Can we be friends ?	06:23
9	-	16 September	-	#125	Rizwan Ali, I don't know who you are and what you want, but please stop sending me friend request again and again. It's very annoying. I'll accept when I'll come to know who you are. But till then please stop...	18:26

11	-	15 September	-	#123	"Manu sir, aapka YouTube channel dekhne ke baad ""Mai toh teri fann ban gayi""!!!  HOW DO YOU PLAY SO MANY INSTRUMENTS????? When can we see you perform live in college? <3"	05:33
12	-	15 September	-	#122	Why are most people in this college so greedy? I am really fed up with these people. They dont help anyone. Many people really insult others of same batch infront of juniors and this should be stopped.	05:19
13	-	15 September	-	#121	I have been feeling very lonely recently. I am a kind of shy person so I need some time to become comfortable with people, when college started everyone were talking with me and as time passed they slowly started dividing into groups and are always hanging out with their friends circle.When I try to join few people now the situation becomes‚Ä¶ More awkward as i don't understand half of what they are talking as it will be some kind of their internal conversation, there are only one or two people who talk to me and I have no friends other than them.	05:16
14	-	15 September	-	#120	The requirements to be a good boyfriend are invited from girls. So that I can judge myself that to whom I am fit as a boyfriend. The requirements will also help us to change ourselves to be fit for our crushes. So girls comment on this as much as possible for you. This is basic need of each single.	05:12
15	-	12 September	-	#119	I really like a girl from UG-1, her name is Fiza and she is really beautiful. Though I have never talked to her, we had small conversations regarding minor issues like she asked me if the chair beside me was empty. I think she is really cute and should have been the Miss Flair. Nevertheless, I am the one who clicks the best pics in the batch and am learning Guitar to impress you. Please talk to me when I approach you!	08:35
16	-	9 September	-	#118	I have a crush on a boy from UG1 who has curly hair and is really smart. He sings well and can also dance. I see him almost everyday but never even had the guts to ask his name. He always roams with other girls which I don't like at all. I just want him to notice me and spend time with me. He is from prithvi house.	13:26
17	-	9 September	-	#117	Ishita , You are the cutest person I have ever seen. Your sweet smile and child like innocence melts my heart. I will love to take you out on a date to your favourite restaurant eating your favourite food. Can we hang out once?UG2-M üòÅüòÅ	09:43

27	-	30 August	-	#109	I am fucking feeling alone in this campus..... It's just that I feel rejected here... As if no one is interested in talking to me or hanging out with me... Some of my batch mates had hurt me a lot till now... Perhaps they don't realise that.... I am really thankful to the admins of this group.... For creating this page.... Even if the confession is not approved.. I will have a relief at least that I spilled everything out......
